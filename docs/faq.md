### FAQ:

**Q: "Where do I report bugs?"** <br>
**A:** You can report bugs to our Github repository's Issues tab. You can also reach out to my discord for help: **@ghostglowdev**.

**Q: "Does this work for other engines** *(other than Psych Engine)***"** <br>
**A:** No, and it's not planned to be updated with support for multiple engines. 

**Q: "What versions of Psych Engine does GhostUtil support?"** <br>
**A:** from 0.6.3 up to the latest version, except 0.7.1, 0.7.1h, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1.

**Q: "Why doesn't this support 0.7.1, 0.7.1h, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1!?!"** <br>
**A:** We had issues with running `runHaxeCode` there. Psych Engine 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 also didn't have their `returnValue`. I'm too lazy to fix that for only those version.

**Q: "Where can I learn about the utility?"** <br>
**A:** Check out the [**<u>GhostUtil Wiki</u>**](), all the methods, fields from each module you require will be there!

**Q: "Does this work on Linux, MacOS or even Mobile Ports?"** <br>
**A:** I cannot give a definitive answer for mobile ports but I'm sure GhostUtil will work fine in Linux and MacOS.

**Q: "Can I use this utility on my mod?"** <br>
**A:** Absolutely, you'll need to credit me though, unless you only used a small part of our utility then it's excused :).

**Q: "Can I take some of the code from GhostUtil?"** <br>
**A:** Yes, you may, credit us if you're taking a large piece of it but there's also a reason we use the MIT License, hun.
