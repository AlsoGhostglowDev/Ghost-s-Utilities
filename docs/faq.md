### FAQ:

**Q: "Where do I report bugs?"** <br>
**A:** You can report bugs to our Github repository's Issues tab. You can also reach out to my discord for help: **@ghostglowdev**.

**Q: "Does this work for other engines** *(other than Psych Engine)***"** <br>
**A:** No, and it's not planned to be updated with support for multiple engines. 

**Q: "What versions of Psych Engine does GhostUtil support?"** <br>
**A:** from 0.6.3 up to the latest version, except 0.7.1, 0.7.1h, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1.

**Q: "Why doesn't this support 0.7.1, 0.7.1h, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1!?!"** <br>
**A:** We had issues with running `runHaxeCode` there. Psych Engine 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 also didn't have their `returnValue`. I'm too lazy to fix that for only those version.

**Q: "Where can I learn about the utility?"** <br>
**A:** Check out the [**<u>GhostUtil Wiki</u>**](https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/Ghost-s-Utilities/wiki), all the methods, fields from each module you require will be there!

**Q: "Does this work on Linux, MacOS or even Mobile Ports?"** <br>
**A:** I cannot give a definitive answer for mobile ports but I'm sure GhostUtil will work fine in Linux and MacOS.

**Q: "Can I use this utility on my mod?"** <br>
**A:** Absolutely, you'll need to credit me though, unless you only used a small part of our utility then it's excused :).

**Q: "Can I take some of the code from GhostUtil?"** <br>
**A:** Yes, you may, credit us if you're taking a large piece of it but there's also a reason we use the MIT License, hun.

**Q: "I'm interested in developing a GhostUtil extension, where can I start?"** <br>
**A:** A template has been prepared in `ghostutil/extensions` called "`dummy.lua`". Feel free to use that to start on your project. You can also check out the [**Developing: GhostUtil Extensions**](https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/Ghost-s-Utilities/wiki/GhostUtil-Extensions) documentation.

**Q: "Is GhostUtil 3 the last major version to be released?"** <br>
**A:** After years in the making, yes. I am finally retiring from developing more onto this utility as Psych has became more dead ever since better alternative such as V-Slice and CodenameEngine began to gain more popularity.

**Q: "What are the main changes in GhostUtil 3.0?"** <br>
**A:** GhostUtil was changed in every aspect from the ground-up. This means v2.1h's code was completely dumped to be rebuilt into a better environment. This also made GhostUtil much easier to work with when dealing with multiple support for older Psych Engine versions. <br> The helper module was also remade to make it easier for the community to make GhostUtil extensions.
